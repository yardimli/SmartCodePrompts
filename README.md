# Smart Code Prompts

**The Open-Source, Local-First AI Coding Companion.**

Smart Code Prompts is a free, self-hosted desktop application that gives you a powerful, private, and flexible environment for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). Built with Electron and powered by the same editor as VS Code, it runs on your machine, connects to any LLM via OpenRouter, and keeps your code completely private.

It's designed for developers who want the benefits of AI assistance without sacrificing control or sending their codebase to a third-party service.

## Why Smart Code Prompts?

In a world of cloud-based AI assistants, Smart Code Prompts offers a different approach:

-   **ðŸ”’ Absolute Privacy:** Your code, project files, and API keys **never leave your computer**. All processing and state management happens locally.
-   **ðŸ”§ Total Control:** You choose the project, the files, the LLM, and the prompt. It's your workflow, amplified.
-   **ðŸ’° No Subscriptions:** It's free and open-source. You only pay for the LLM usage you incur via your own API key.
-   **ðŸ”Œ Use Any Model:** Through OpenRouter.ai, you can access hundreds of models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more. Pick the best tool for the job, from the fastest small models to the most powerful large ones.
-   **ðŸš€ Open Source:** The entire application is open for you to inspect, modify, and contribute to. No black boxes.

## Getting Started

1.  **Launch the App:** Open Smart Code Prompts.
2.  **Add a Project:** On the right sidebar, click the "Project" dropdown and select "Add New Project...". Choose a local folder containing a codebase.
3.  **Set Your API Key:**
   -   Click the **Set API Key** button on the right sidebar.
   -   Get a key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
   -   Paste your key (it starts with `sk-or-...`) and save. It is stored securely on your local machine.
4.  **Explore Your Code:** Browse the file tree on the left. Click on files to open them in the editor.
5.  **Build a Prompt:** Check the boxes next to files in the tree. Their content will be automatically added to the main "Prompt" tab.
6.  **Run a Prompt:** Type a question or instruction into the prompt input box at the bottom and click "Run" to send your selected file context and your question to the LLM.

## Security

Your security and privacy are paramount.
-   All filesystem access is restricted to the project directories you explicitly add.
-   Your OpenRouter API key and all application state are stored in a local SQLite database on your machine.
-   No files or code are ever sent to any external server, except when you explicitly trigger an LLM action (like running a prompt or analysis), at which point the selected content is sent to OpenRouter.ai.
